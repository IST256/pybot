<h3>Welcome to pybot</h3>
<p><b>Your AI Programming Assistant powered by OpenAI Codex.</b></p>
<p>My name is Michael Fudge and I am a professor of practice at Syracuse University. <br>
I am inviting you to participate in a research study for Spring 2023. I am interested in studying <br>
<em>how AI programming assistants affect student learning in programming courses</em>, such as this one.</p>

<p>This AI assistant can help you to write, understand and debug code. As with any tool <br>
on the internet, data is collected while you use it. Before you can use this AI assistant, <br>
I ask you whether or not the data collected by it may be used for research purposes. </p>

<p>Involvement in the study is voluntary and will not impact your grade in the course. <br>
This means you can choose whether to participate and that you may withdraw from the study <br>
at any time without penalty. I will not have access to the research participation data until <br>
after grades are submitted. If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about the research <br> 
please contact me at <a href="mailto:mafudge@syr.edu">mafudge@syr.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever one works with email or the internet, there is always the risk of compromising privacy,  <br>
confidentiality, and/or anonymity. Your confidentiality will be maintained to the degree permitted <br>
by the technology being used. It is important for you to understand that no guarantees can be made <br>
regarding the interception of data sent via the internet by third parties. </p>

<p>If you are 18 years of age or older, click: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Opt-In</b> If you AGREE to partcipcate in the study, or  
  <li><b>Opt-Out</b> If you DO NOT AGREEE to partcipcate in the study.
</ul>  
</p>

<p>You may change your participation in the study at any time by typing:<br>
<code>%%pybot opt</code> and pressing enter 3 times into an empty code cell.</p>
